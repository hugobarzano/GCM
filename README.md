# Generative Cloud Manager: Code Runner

Code-Runner is a Open Source project that aims to automate software
applications development and deployment with a generative approach
into cloud virtual environments.

Full integrated with Github as source code control system, Code-Runner
provides to developers all resources needed to build and deploy web 
applications or cloud services cleanly and quickly. 

## How it works?

Code-Runner use a high-level specification as input to generate a
completely application ( Repository, CI/CD workflow, Source Code,
configuration, tools and documentation) deployed and available over
Internet using Docker technology. 

Code-Runner generation capabilities supports the following applications nature:

 - One Single-Page Applications
 - API-Rest Applications
 - Data Services
 - DevOps Services
 
 ## Available Environments

Code runner provides to developers of two environments to generate their applications: 

| ENV | Description                                                                                                                                                               | URL                              |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| PRO | Full Deployed over Google Cloud, this environment provides to developer TLS security and a set of virtual resources to generate and deploy large  number of applications. | https://apps.gcm-coderunner.com  |
| DEV | Combined with Heroku and Google Cloud this environments is used for development purposes.                                                                                 | https://coderunner.herokuapp.com |
